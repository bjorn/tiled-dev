Connections between these objects are now maintained when pasting or
duplicating objects, the Defold export plugin now supports rotated tiles and
the German translation was updated.

A number of other fixes and small improvements were made as well, as detailed
in the below changelog.

In the meantime, we're also getting very close to the Tiled 1.9 release, so
this is likely going to be the last patch release to [Tiled 1.8][tiled-1-8].
Many changes have followed since the [Tiled 1.9 Alpha][tiled-1-9-alpha], so the
plan is to make a 1.9 Beta release soon.
